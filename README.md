# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
 for this project, an analysis is to be conducted on all the PyBer rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 to visually illustrate and compare the following among Urban, Suburban, and Rural areas: 

- the total number of rides, 
- average fares, 
- and total number of drivers.

to visually represent the data, the results will be elucidated through the use of bubble charts, bar-and-whisker plots, and pie charts will be used. this data will be used to help determine the affordability as well as improve the access to ride-sharing services for neighborhoods that appear underserved.

## Results:
There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.

## Summary:
There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
