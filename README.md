# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
 for this project, an analysis is to be conducted on all the PyBer rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 to visually illustrate and compare the following among Urban, Suburban, and Rural areas: 

- the total number of rides
- average fares
- and total number of drivers

To visually represent the data, the results will be elucidated through the use of bubble charts, bar-and-whisker plots, and pie charts will be used. this data will be used to help determine the affordability as well as improve the access to ride-sharing services for neighborhoods that appear underserved.

## Results:

figure 1 - Bubble chart comparing the average fare charted against the number of rides for each city type

Above is figure 1, a bubble chart comparing the average fare charted against the number of rides for each city type. The size of the bubble has a correlation with the number of drivers for that point. The color of the bubble determines the city type, following this format:

- Urban : Coral
- Suburban : sky blue
- Rural : Gold

from this chart a few findings are discovered, Urban cities tend to be the most active among all city types, while also accumulating a lower fare on average. Rural city types seem to oppose Urban cities, having the least activity yet a higher fare on average. Urban areas also have more drivers than all other city types and rural cities have less drivers. Suburban cities tend to fall directly in the middle for both activity and average fare amount.

Above is figure 2, a box-and-whisker plot of the ride count data which displays the range of the number of rides that occurs for each city type. From this chart the data almost mirrors what the bubble chart from figure 1 was implicating. The number of rides for urban cities is higher on average when compared to Suburban and rural areas. an outlier can be seen only from the Urban city type, in which a ride count of 39 is preformed in the city of West Angela.

figure 3 - Box-and-whisker plot of the Ride fare Data

Above is figure 3, a box-and-whisker plot of the ride fare data which displays the range of fares that occurs for each city type. similarly, the correlation between figure 1 and figure 3 average fares is present. The average fare for urban cities is lower on average when compared to Suburban and rural areas. Rural areas overall have the highest average fare in comparision to other city types.

## Summary:
There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
