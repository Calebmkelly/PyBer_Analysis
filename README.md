# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
 for this project, an analysis is to be conducted on all the PyBer rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 to visually illustrate and compare the following among Urban, Suburban, and Rural areas: 

- the total number of rides
- average fares
- and total number of drivers

To visually represent the data, the results will be elucidated through the use of bubble charts, bar-and-whisker plots, and pie charts will be used. this data will be used to help determine the affordability as well as improve the access to ride-sharing services for neighborhoods that appear underserved.

## Results:
