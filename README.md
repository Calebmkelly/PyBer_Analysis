# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
 for this project, an analysis is to be conducted on all the PyBer rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 to visually illustrate and compare the following among Urban, Suburban, and Rural areas: 

- the total number of rides
- average fares
- and total number of drivers

To visually represent the data, the results will be elucidated through the use of bubble charts, bar-and-whisker plots, and pie charts will be used. this data will be used to help determine the affordability as well as improve the access to ride-sharing services for neighborhoods that appear underserved.

## Results:

figure 1 - Bubble chart comparing the average fare charted against the number of rides for each city type
![Fig1.png](https://github.com/Calebmkelly/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Fig1.png)

Above is figure 1, a bubble chart comparing the average fare charted against the number of rides for each city type. The size of the bubble has a correlation with the number of drivers for that point. The color of the bubble determines the city type, following this format:

- Urban : Coral
- Suburban : sky blue
- Rural : Gold

from this chart a few findings are discovered, Urban cities tend to be the most active among all city types, while also accumulating a lower fare on average. Rural city types seem to oppose Urban cities, having the least activity yet a higher fare on average. Urban areas also have more drivers than all other city types and rural cities have less drivers. Suburban cities tend to fall directly in the middle for both activity and average fare amount.

figure 2 - Box-and-whisker plot of the Ride count Data

Above is figure 2, a box-and-whisker plot of the ride count data which displays the range of the number of rides that occurs for each city type. From this chart the data almost mirrors what the bubble chart from figure 1 was implicating. The number of rides for urban cities is higher on average when compared to Suburban and rural areas. an outlier can be seen only from the Urban city type, in which a ride count of 39 is preformed in the city of West Angela.

figure 3 - Box-and-whisker plot of the Ride fare Data
![Fig3.png](https://github.com/Calebmkelly/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Fig3.png)

Above is figure 3, a box-and-whisker plot of the ride fare data which shows the range of fares that occurs for each city type. similarly, the correlation between figure 1 and figure 3 average fares is present. The average fare for urban cities is lower on average when compared to Suburban and rural areas. Rural areas overall have the highest average fare in comparision to other city types. 

figure 4 - Box-and-whisker plot of the driver count data
![Fig4.png](https://github.com/Calebmkelly/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Fig4.png)

Above is figure 4, a box-and-whisker plot of the driver count data which demonstrates the range of the number of drivers that occurs for each city type. from the figure 4 can it be shown that the majority of drivers gravitate towards Urban cities, with urban cities having a significantly higher amount of drivers than both Suburban cities and rural cities.

figure 5 - Pie chart of the total fares data
![Fig5.png](https://github.com/Calebmkelly/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Fig5.png)

Above is figure 5, a pie chart that presents the percentage value of the total fares for each city type. Urban cities attribute to having the majority of the total amount fares with a whopping 62.7%. it should be noted that although rural areas on average have a higher fare price, the accumulation of smaller average fares provides how the activity in Urban areas is substantial. Rural cities only account for 6.8% of total fares, and Suburban cities lying in the middle again with 30.5%.

figure 6 - Pie chart of the total rides data
![Fig6.png](https://github.com/Calebmkelly/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Fig6.png)

Above is figure 6, a pie chart that presents the percentage value of the total rides for each city type. once again, Urban Cites provide for the largest portion of the pie, taking up 68.4% of the total rides. falling a close second was the suburban city type with 26.3%, and Rural cities having the least amount of rides, making up only 5.3%. 

figure 7 - Pie chart of the total rides data
![Fig7.png](https://github.com/Calebmkelly/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Fig7.png)

Above is figure 7, a pie chart that presents the percentage value of the total drivers for each city type. Urban cities have a significant portion of drivers adding up to a 80.9% of the total drivers for PyBer. Suburban cities account for 16.5% percent of drivers, leaving rural city types to have a mere 2.6%. 

figure 8 - line chart of the total fares data
![PyBer_fare_summary.png](https://github.com/Calebmkelly/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png)

above is figure 8, The PyBer fare summary, a line chart depicting the total fare by city type over the course of January to the beginning of May of 2019 on a weekly basis. Unlike the previous figures, figure 7 shows data over a time period, providing more depth to the analysis. as seen previously, Urban cities presents itself to have a higher fare amount that topples over suburban and rural city types, with suburban cites lying in the middle, and rural cities having the lowest fare amount. Even with dips and surges, the graph trends at a steady pace for all the city types.


## Summary:
Based on the data that was given here are three Business proposals for PyBer's ride sharing service: 
- Rural areas seem to have the least development amongst other city types, this could be due to a variety of factors such as rural areas being less dense and more spread out. it may be wise to invest more drivers in under served rural areas that are more compact or that are closer to densly populated areas such as nearby towns or cities. 
- with a large portion of rides taking place in urban areas, increasing the fare price ever so genlty can provide a large boost in revenue over time.
- perhaps getting peoples attention is something that could help drive PyBer towards even more success, ride activity could increase with the use of promotional deals and offers, especially in urban and sub urban cities.
